Ans9 : Gini Index = 1-(0.40 x 0.40 + 0.60 x 0.60)
		    0.48
       Entropy = [(40/100)*log2 (40/100)] - [(60/100)*log2 (60/100)]
Ans10: Advantages of Random Forests over Decision tree are :-
	1. Reduce the overfitting.
	2. It's Bagging & boosting algorithem, which help to maintain the bias & variance for more accurate model.
Ans11: Basically it will helps to normalize the data which may lead to increase the calculation speed of selected algirithem.
       Types of Scalling Techniques :-
	1. Min-Max Scaler
	2. Standard Scaler
Ans12:  Min-Max Scaler
Ans13: No, Accuracy is not a good metric to measure the performance of the model beacuse :-
	it does not distinguish between the numbers of correctly classified examples of different classes. Hence, it may lead to erroneous conclusions.
Ans14: F-Score is used to test the test's accuracy by :
	F-Score = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
Ans15: Fit() - Its calculate the parameters of particular technique
       Transform() - To apply the transformation to any particular set of examples.
       fit_transform() - Joins these two steps and is used for the initial fitting of parameters on the training set, while also returning the transformed.
